# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

The aim of the project is to analyze and create a summary dataframe of the ridesharing data by city type, and finally visualize total weekly fares for each city type from Janaury onwards via a line-graph. We will be able to infer how data differs from each city type and how these differences can be used by the ride sharing company, Pyber.

## Results

After analysing our first task in Deliverable 1 and based on image below, the data showed that total rides, total driver and total fares have a direct link with each other. The data from average fare per ride and average fare per driver had an inverse relationship.

After analysing our Deliverable 2 and based on image below, we were able to visualize the data in a line-chart, which shows total fares for each city type every week.

* The Rural fares started at $200. The fares increased and dropped till the end of April.
* The Suburban fares started ~$1,000, which is not profitable. The fares dropped in March and in mid-April  
* The Urban fares started with an average of $1,800, and then increased consistently to ~$2,300. 

## Summary 

Based on our analysis, I have three recommendations:

1. We need to focus marketing in rural areas so more customers are attracted to travel by way of availability of more drivers.
2. We should also focus on making service affordable for people living in rural areas by adding a 'max fare limit' or 'cap' on the fare so more people will be willing to utilize the service.
3. Since there is usually heavy activity in urban areas and is by far the most profitable, we should implement marketing tactics by focusing on tailored service and less wait times based on availability of drivers.
