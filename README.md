# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

The aim of the project is to analyze and create a summary dataframe of the ridesharing data by city type, and finally visualize total weekly fares for each city type from Janaury onwards via a line-graph. We will be able to infer how data differs from each city type and how these differences can be used by the ride sharing company, Pyber.

## Results

After analysing our first task and based on image below, the data showed that total rides, total driver and total fares have a direct link with each other. The data from average fare per ride and average fare per driver had an inverse relationship.
